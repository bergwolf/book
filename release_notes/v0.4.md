# Version 0.4 (2015-09-18)

In version 0.4, Hyper moved the hypervisor runtime to [runV](https://github.com/hyperhq/runv) project,
which [implements](https://github.com/opencontainers/specs/blob/master/implementations.md) the [OCI Specs](https://github.com/opencontainers/specs).

## Highlight features

- The hypervisor support has been moved to runV.
- No more dependency on Docker Daemon, i.e. it is not necessary to install Docker before installing hyper any more.

## Other improvements

- Mac OS X support code merged to master branch, making the following feature available on Linux:
  - Image management capabilities, including `pull`, `push`, `images`, `rmi`, `commit`.
  - Support for building standard Docker images with `Dockerfile.`
  - Support for `--rm` flag for `run` command: a Pod can now automatically be removed when finished.
  - Support for removing multiples Pod in one `rm` command line.
- Support for port mapping configuration in `run` command line.
- Many bug fixes.
